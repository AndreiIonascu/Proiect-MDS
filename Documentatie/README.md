## Bug Reports:

- We had a bug where it didn't remove the books from the list the right way.(indexing problem)
- A bug that we encountered was also the way we show the alert, we used to let all the allerts there instead of making them disappear.

## Refactoring:

- The code was updated and implemented the part where it has to store books.
- We arranged the code to easier understanding.
- The code was written after and we used better coding practices.
